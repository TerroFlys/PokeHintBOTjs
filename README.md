# PokeHint BOTjs

---

> I made this bot first in Java and now I remade it in JavaScript, using discord.js.
> This bot reveals the answers from poketwo from seeing the hint.

> The bot will automatically see poketwo's hints and answer in thesame channel that send the hint
> Alternatively you could use the bots command 'tb! hint <hint>' the bot will reply to your message with what he thinks the answer is.
